# Planetbase-TimeMod

This is an update of João Farias' "Free Building" mod, written to be compatible with my modding framework. 90% of the code in this project (specifically the contents of the "ReplacementMethod" in this file: https://github.com/solidDoWant/Planetbase-FreeBuilding/blob/master/Planetbase-FreeBuilding/Patches/Planetbase/Module/CanPlaceModuleClass.cs) is his code.

Adds the following features:
* Relaxes requirements on building placement

Credits
* João Farias - the original creator of the mod. Source: https://bitbucket.org/joaofarias/planetbase-modding/src/592951366d8b1eeae19d04aa2aac5dec8d5881fa/FreeBuilding/?at=master. The actual "actionable" code for this mod is a near copy-paste of his code.
